# GemFire Journey Loader
As part of the startup process, journeys identified via offline batch training are loaded
into GemFire for use by the dashboard.  This module provides a Spring Boot based program
that reads the input file (as provided by the batch training) and loads each record into
GemFire.  The persistence and domain objects for this module are provided by the
IoT-GemFireCommons module.

To run this application:

```
$ java -jar IoT-GemFireLoader.jar clusters.json
```

where IoT-GemFireLoader.jar is the jar file generated by building this module and
clusters.json is the json file outputted by the batch training.
