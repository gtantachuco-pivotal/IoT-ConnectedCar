# Python scripts to simulate real-time streaming data
## Streaming through standard out

`stdout.py` takes a single paramter `path` to the file that it streams. It converts each row to json and prints the json to stdout.

Example call: `python StreamMockup/stdout.py Data/Historical/trackLog-2014-Mai-23_22-02-57.csv`
